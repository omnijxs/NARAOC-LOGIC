NEW FEATURES:
[ ] PopUnit reallocation.

IMPROVEMENTS:
[ ] Multiplication: copy correct properties and resolve tile of the new PopUnit.
[ ] A better way to map demand to cities.

BUGS:
[ ] PopUnitSorter.productionSort works correctly but should not.

DESIGN:
[ ] More in-depth design of testing
    { } Logic tests -> Trait testing
    { } Implementation tests -> Class testing
    { } End-to-end tests -< Use case testing

    [ ] ProducesTest does not have tests for fallback (ArmyUnit-case) or override (Farmer-case)
    [ ] Create a TestData trait for all test setup scenarios.
