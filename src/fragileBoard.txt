## VERSION 0.11

IMPROVEMENTS:
[ ]: Improvements to PopUnit - interface
    {D}: Create public methods canBeTaxed(), canMultiply() and canReallocate(). 
         These are the only methods that can be called "outside" pop unit. 23.12.2015
    {D}: Remove State as an unnecessary abstraction. Will break lots of tests. Fix them. 27.12.2015
    {D}: Use canMultiply() and canReallocate() in correct places. 27.12.2015
    { }: Use canBeTaxed() when taxing a pop unit. Will require major changes to Refines- and Taxes- traits.
    { }: Create tests for isObedient(), canBeTaxed(), canMultiply(), canReallocate()?
         canReallocate is already indirectly tested via ReallocatesTest and canMultiply via MultiplyTest.

NEW FEATURES:
[ ]: BUILDINGS: FEATURE!
[ ]: RESOURCES: FEATURE!
[ ]: ARMY UNIT: PROTO-PROJECT!
[ ]: MAGIC UNIT: PROTO-PROJECT!

IMPROVEMENTS:
[ ]: MULTIPLICATION: Copy correct properties and resolve tile of the new PopUnit.
[ ]: REALLOCATION: Deal with popUnit state: obedience penalties and tile calculation. Will require information about PopUnit 'owner' even though basic pop units don't have an owner.
[ ]: REALLOCATION: Deal with armyUnit & magicUnit type.
[ ]: OBEDIENCE: Use currentTurn to calculate timed violations.
[ ]: OBEDIENCE: removeObsolete() - method to sanitize violations list: remove unnecessary timed violations.
[ ]: A better way to map demand to cities.
[ ]: Create a TestData trait for all test setup scenarios.

[ ]: Taxes.tax or game algorithm should take into account player upkeep.
[ ]: Tests for Taxes.turnData and Refines.turnData behavior.

[ ]: DATA FLOW: Access to GameData via Trait? Make a proto!

BUGS:
[ ] PopUnitSorter.productionSort works correctly but should not.

[D]: OBEDIENCE: A pop unit now has obedience. No rules implemented and no place to add them in code yet. 22.12.2015
[D]: TAXATION: Taxes-trait does the trick! 16.12.2015
[D]: There should be a third popUnitFinder-method: All popUnits should produce only for the preferredCity. 16.12.2015
[D]: Add testCases for popUnitsMultiply, popUnitsProduce, popHubsRefine, gameActorsSetup, feedArmies in TurnAlgorithm. 16.12.2015
[D]: Add refinesTestCases. 16.12.2015
[D]: Internalize the turnData-information to Refine-trait. 16.12.2015
[D]: Store turn specific output in PopHub - not in gameData! 15.12.2015
[D] FeedsTile & FeedsArmy - traits have slightly incorrect functionality. WHAT IS THE LEVEL TO CHECK WE DO NOT FEED NON STARVING UNITS!!! 15.12.2015
[D] Interface implementation for PopHub refining production. 10.12.2015
[D] PopUnit reallocation. Create new and remove old. 8.12.2015
[D] PopUnit multiplication. Very basic implementation. 02.12.2015
[D] A better way to deal with PopUnit priority. -> Priority ENUM!
[D] Rename FeedsCity to FeedsHub
[D] PopUnitFinder should have two different population search methods: for production and for feeding. Also no popHub parameter required. 02.12.2015
[D] Player should have an interface. 01.12.2015
[D] Produces.produce should get gameData as parameter. 30.11.2015
[D] Remove GameMap-object as an unnecessary abstraction. 30.11.2015
[D] Use productAmount value everywhere instead of hardcoded value. 30.11.2015
[D] PopUnit-class has a state which holds all relevant information such as Race, Obedience, Age etc. 20.11.2015
[D] A better way to deal with PopUnit priority. -> Priority ENUM!
